## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Osinachi.

I'm a developer that values good stories. I seek to improve the human condition through technology. I'm also building a community at Owerri Nigeria.

### My blog
I keep a regular blog on Hashnode. Check it out [here](https://vicradon.hashnode.dev).

### How did I get here?
I got into all these through the help of thousands of developers out there, most especially [Samson Amaugo](https://github.com/sammychinedu2ky). I'm grateful to everyone.

### Current Status
I'm currently relearning the core of frontend development.
