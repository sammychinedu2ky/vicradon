### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Osinachi.
I am a developer that values good stories. I seek to improve the human condition through technology. I'm also building a community at Owerri Nigeria.

I got into all these through the help of thousands of developers out there, most especially [Samson Amaugo](https://github.com/sammychinedu2ky). I'm grateful to everyone.
